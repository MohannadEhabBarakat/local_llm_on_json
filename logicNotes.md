prompt 2
takes data + question returns answer 

## Data cleaning
- remove the word String
- any "" or '' should be none
- drop any FileAttachment key
- drop ginfo for now (ask later)
<!-- - drop trips for now (ask later) -->
- sortable keys are 
    - ["country", "moi", "defense", "energy", "mofa", "qia", "qffd", "moci"]
- Summary keys are
    - ["talkingPoints", "outStandings", "trips"]
- If a key has a list value that has only one value in it compress it 

## Time plan
- **Mon**: Data cleaning âœ… ~4hours
- **Tue**: Data cleaning + LLAMA 3.1 70B or 8B + logic
- **Wed**: fastapi + Deploy first iteration (on 48 70B should be fine)
